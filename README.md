## **Tenative Project: https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot**

**Operational Environment:** Enterprise

**Motivations:** We are all intrested in AI and the impact that it can have on the security posture of the enterprise. 

**What is it:** This is a research project to see how can GPT-4 be utilized to generate fully working, production-ready, apps. The main idea is that AI can write most of the code for an app (maybe 95%) but for the rest 5%, a developer is and will be needed until we get full AGI.

**Contributors:** Small team comprised of 15 people. 

**Discord:** [Project Server](https://discord.com/invite/FWnRZdCb)

There has been no security incidents with this open source project because it is so new.


# **Proposal Check List**
- [ ] A link to your team's public GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task.
- [ ] Name of an open-source software project your team has chosen to work on. From here on, it will be referred to as “software”.
- [ ] Describe a hypothetical operational environment (e.g., home, office, enterprise, bank, government, etc.) where the users will expect security functionality from the software.
    - [ ] Provide a diagram that identifies the systems engineering viewLinks to an external site. of the software in the hypothetical environment. 
    - [ ] What are the threats perceived by users of the software in its intended operational environment? (If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your project selection.)
    - [ ] Develop a list of security features in the software (Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice).
- [ ] Team motivation for selecting this project.
- [ ] Open-source project description (What is it?, Contributors, Activity, Use, Popularity, Languages used, platform, documentation sources, etc. You can get some of this information from Github or OpenHubLinks to an external site.)
- [ ] Discuss License, procedures for making contributions, and contributor agreementsLinks to an external site.
- [ ] A brief summary of security-related history for the software (E.g., known vulnerabilities, security-related engineering decisions, security feature additions/removal, etc. ).
- [ ] nclude a reflection on your teamwork for this assignment. What issues occurred? How did you resolve them? What did you plan to change moving forward?

operational environment: Enterprise 

Motivations: We are all intrested in AI and the impact that it can have on the security posture of the enterprise. 

What is it: This is a research project to see how can GPT-4 be utilized to generate fully working, production-ready, apps. The main idea is that AI can write most of the code for an app (maybe 95%) but for the rest 5%, a developer is and will be needed until we get full AGI.

Contributors: Small team comprised of 15 people.
